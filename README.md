# Mini crypto project
a small project on blockchain to implement basic features for a functioning blockchain
### key concepts of this project-
* HTTP interface to control the node
* Use Websockets to communicate with other nodes (P2P)
* Super simple "protocols" in P2P communication
* Data is not persisted in nodes
* No proof-of-work or proof-of-stake: a block can be added to the blockchain without competition
